dear all,
there is an URL there it is wrongly stated that my code "donlp2" has the 
commercial status "free". it is by no means free for commercial applications, 
the commercial exploration rights are with my university TU Darmstadt and 
commercial usages without licensing/royalty will be prosecuted. it is free 
for research purposes. this all is clearly stated in the heading of the source.
enjoy in using it (legal)
peter
